## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Download the Files
Download all 11 files from the outputs folder in this conversation and place them in your project root.

### Step 2: Add Files to Your Project
```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory
cd /path/to/MERICA

# Copy the downloaded files to your project
# (Copy each file to its corresponding location)

# Verify files are there
ls -la
ls -la .github/
```

### Step 3: Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Check status
git status
```

### Step 4: Stage All Files
```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Verify what's being committed
git status
```

### Step 5: Make Your First Commit
```bash
# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Initial commit: MERICA Trader marketplace with PostgreSQL integration"
```

### Step 6: Connect to GitHub
```bash
# Add your remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/CPG-Ai/MERICA.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Set main branch
git branch -M main
```

### Step 7: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Push everything to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about conflicts:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 8: Verify on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/CPG-Ai/MERICA
2. Check all files are there
3. View the README
4. Confirm .gitignore worked (no node_modules, .env visible)

- 📋 Issue templates for organized bug reports and features
- 🤝 PR template for consistent code reviews
- 📜 Proper license and contribution guidelines
- 🗂️ Clean repository (no node_modules or secrets)

### In Your Workflow
```bash
# Future workflow after initial push:

# 1. Make changes to code
# 2. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push

# 4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
#    - Run tests
#    - Check types

## 📋 Files That Should NOT Be on GitHub

These are automatically ignored by `.gitignore`:
- ❌ `node_modules/`
- ❌ `.env` (with real secrets)
- ❌ `.next/` (build artifacts)
- ❌ `dist/`
- ❌ `*.log` files
- ❌ IDE config files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)

---

## 🔐 Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit API keys or secrets**
   - Use `.env.example` as template
   - Keep real `.env` files local
   - Add secrets to GitHub Secrets (Settings → Secrets)

2. **Review before first push**
   ```bash
   git status           # See what's being committed
   git diff --staged    # Review actual changes
   ```

3. **Protect your main branch** (after push)
   - Go to Settings → Branches
   - Add branch protection rule
   - Require PR reviews before merging

## 🎯 After GitHub Push - Let's Build!

Once everything is pushed, come back here and we'll:
1. Choose a feature to build
2. Work on it together
3. I'll create the code/files
4. You download and push to GitHub
5. Repeat! 🚀

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't push - permission denied
- Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub
- Use it as your password when pushing

### Repository already exists error
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/CPG-Ai/MERICA.git
```

### Large files warning
```bash
# Find large files
find . -type f -size +50M

# Add to .gitignore if needed
```

### Need to undo a commit (before push)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
```
